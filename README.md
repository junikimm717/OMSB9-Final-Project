# Juni's MSB Final Project (Redone)

This project will concern experimental results from subitizing from peripheral
vision.

The website is **meant** to be run on localhost, and will send all appropriate
data to a file called data.txt.

With the data that I have, I will be able to

1. Conduct an ANOVA test to determine if subitizing speed and accuracy depends
   on angle viewed, and

2. Conduct a simple linear regression to determine how accurate participants
   are with certain numbers over others (and do the same over angle).

# Technology stack

- Plain old PHP (Django took too long for me to use)

- Vanilla Javascript
