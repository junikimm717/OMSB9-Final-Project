# Analyses to make

Within my paper, I am going to make the following analyses:

- Average accuracy by number (testing standard deviation of guesses and the
    mean deviation from the correct answer)

- Average accuracy and standard deviation by reaction speed (conduct an SRCC Test)

- Accuracy by peripheral vision (Conduct an ANOVA Test)

- Comparisons of near and far peripheral vision to each other (how much does
        angle make a difference? Is it just non-foveal vision?)
